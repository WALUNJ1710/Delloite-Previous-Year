After JEE Mains, some students got admission into an engineering college. Now there is a class consisting of such n students, and the HOD came to say it is time to select the class monitor. But He never gets all of them at one time. So he brought a register, every time he gets someone with less rank than the previous time he cut the name and wrote the name of the student and the rank.
For a given number of ranks he gets each time, you have to predict how many names are cut in the list.

ranks <=10000

*Input Format*:

N space separated ranks the HOD gets each time

*Output Format*:
